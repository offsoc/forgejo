---

This is a cheat sheet for the Forgejo configuration file. It contains the settings
that can be configured as well as their default values.

Any changes to the Forgejo configuration file should be made in `custom/conf/app.ini`
or any corresponding location. When installing from a distribution, this will
typically be found at `/etc/forgejo/app.ini`.

In the default values below, a value in the form `$XYZ` refers to an environment variable. See [environment-to-ini](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/contrib/environment-to-ini) for information on how environment variables are translated to `app.ini` variables. Values in the form _`XxYyZz`_ refer to values listed as part of the default configuration. These notation forms will not work in your own `app.ini` file and are only listed here as documentation.

Any string in the format `%(X)s` is a feature powered by [ini](https://github.com/go-ini/ini/#recursive-values), for reading values recursively.

Values containing `#` or `;` must be quoted using `` ` `` or `"""`.

**Note:** A full restart is required for Forgejo configuration changes to take effect.

## Default configuration (non-`app.ini` configuration)

These values are environment-dependent but form the basis of a lot of values. They will be reported as part of the default configuration when running `forgejo help` or on start-up. The order they are emitted there is slightly different but we will list them here in the order they are set-up.

- _`AppPath`_: This is the absolute path of the running `forgejo` binary.

- _`AppWorkPath`_: This refers to "working path" of the `forgejo` binary. It is determined by using the first set thing in the following hierarchy:
  1. The `WORK_PATH` option in "app.ini" file
  2. The `--work-path` flag passed to the binary
  3. The environment variable `$FORGEJO_WORK_DIR`
  4. The environment variable `$GITEA_WORK_DIR`
  5. A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  6. Otherwise it defaults to the directory of the _`AppPath`_

  If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against the directory of the _`AppPath`_.

- _`CustomPath`_: This is the base directory for custom templates and other options. It is determined by using the first set thing in the following hierarchy:
  1. The `--custom-path` flag passed to the binary
  2. The environment variable `$FORGEJO_CUSTOM`
  3. The environment variable `$GITEA_CUSTOM`
  4. A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  5. Otherwise it defaults to _`AppWorkPath`_`/custom`

  If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against the directory of the _`AppWorkPath`_.

- _`CustomConf`_: This is the path to the `app.ini` file.
  1. The `--config` flag passed to the binary
  2. A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  3. Otherwise it defaults to _`CustomPath`_`/conf/app.ini`

  If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against the directory of the _`CustomPath`_.

- _`StaticRootPath`_: This can be set as a built-in at build time, but will otherwise default to _`AppWorkPath`_.
