## Attribution

Forgejo translators are attributed in commit messages and in monthly updates on the website.

Gitea translators are mostly not attributed in this repository because Gitea translation commits are lacking attribution, but it may be preserved on Crowdin.

This directory contains a legacy `TRANSLATORS` file from the Gogs era. It is opt-in and is not actively maintained.
